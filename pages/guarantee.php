			<br />
			At Sierra Trading Post, the concept of value goes both ways. We strive to give you the best value for your money. And we place a great value on your business. If you are not completely satisfied with every purchase you make, you may return it for any reason, at any time. That's the essence of our unconditional guarantee.<br /><br />
			
			With the Sierra Trading Post 100% satisfaction guarantee, there's no time limit, no red tape, and no complicated forms to fill out. Just pack up your item, include your original packing slip or your name and address and send it back to us at any time. We will send your requested replacement item right away or credit your account for the full price. We will even refund your shipping charges if you feel we have made a mistake in your order.<br /><br />
			
			Just how serious are we about our guarantee? Completely serious. A customer once returned a pair of shoes that had been so well worn, they were held together with hog rings. When we learned that he had never been happy with the shoes, we didn't think twice about sending him a refund. He's still a valued customer today.<br /><br />
			
			That pair of shoes now hangs on a plaque in our office as a reminder to everyone that you - our customer - are our first priority. That's a promise we back up with one of the most robust guarantees in the business.
